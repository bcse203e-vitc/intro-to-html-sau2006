    <p>Everything steers impossible against the boundless curb of light. 
        Believe I tried for you. Against space. Time takes almost everything away. To you.
        For you. I almost wish I'd never seen the sky when always there was you. <br> <i>- Keith S. Wilson</i>

    <p>Wish you would walk through my door. Stare out from the mirror. Come through the pipes.<br> <i>- Gabrielle Calvocoressi</i></p>
